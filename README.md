# MRCPlus OBS Client

An OBS plugin for interacting with the [MRCPlus](https://www.github.com/Raemien/MRCPlus) Quest mod.
This extends MRC with various new utilities and stability improvements.

While Facebook hasn't maintained the original repo since 2019, this fork aims to bring enhancements to the plugin.
